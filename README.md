# Wood3D

A browser-based 3D designer for plywood cabinets. Sketch rectangular carcasses
from panels, resize them freely (thickness stays locked), and generate a cutlist
— all client-side, no backend. Designs export to a `.json` file and re-import,
so the whole thing can be hosted as a static site.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build into dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build locally
```

Deploy by publishing the `dist/` folder to any static host (GitHub Pages,
Netlify, S3, …).

## How it works

The design is a plain list of **panels** held in one store. Everything else —
the 3D scene and the cutlist — is a *derived view* of that list, never a second
source of truth. Get the data model right and the rest follows.

A `Panel` is a rectangular piece described by a face (`length` × `width`) and a
`thickness` running along its `normal` axis. Thickness is the one dimension you
cannot change by dragging in the viewport; it is edited in the properties panel
and follows the chosen material. All measurements are stored in millimetres; the
scene is rendered in metres (see `MM_TO_M`).

### Units

Storage is always millimetres — units are only about entry and display
(`lib/units.ts`). A design has one default unit (mm / cm / inch, saved in the
file), used for bare numbers and as the starting display unit. Any field accepts
an explicit unit though — `24.5 in`, `3/4"`, `23 3/4`, `2.5cm`, `5 ft` — and
remembers it, so you can have thickness in mm next to a width in inches.
Inches display as shop-friendly fractions to the nearest 1/16".

## Status

Core loop, the assembly-aware tools, and the **cutlist** are shipped, all under
the rule that **the size you set is the size you cut** — panels are never
auto-resized.

The **Cutlist** view (toolbar → *Cutlist*) is the payoff: enter your sheet
goods (per material + thickness), set a global **kerf** and **margin**, and the
parts nest onto sheets — grouped by material + thickness — as a scaled cut
diagram with waste per material. **Grain** is per part (default: the longer
edge); a grained part stays grain-parallel to the sheet, a grain-free part may
rotate 90° for a tighter pack. Parts whose material + thickness has no stock are
surfaced under **Missing stock** with a one-click *Add sheet* that pre-fills the
right material and thickness. All matching stock sizes are used (not just the
first): parts fill open sheets, and a new sheet is the smallest stock that fits,
so offcuts/small sheets go first and waste drops. Stock **quantities** are
honoured — the packer never invents sheets; parts that then don't fit are
reported as *Not enough stock*. The per-sheet packer (`lib/nesting.ts`) is
MaxRects (best-short-side-fit) with first-fit-decreasing input — it reclaims the
scrap a shelf packer leaves below short parts. Swappable behind the same
signature for a full solver later.

### Ideas for later

- **Rotation.** Add a real rotation to `Panel` (beyond the discrete
  thickness-axis) plus a rotate gizmo, with **snapping like move and resize**
  (snap to common angles / neighbour orientations). Cut dimensions are
  unaffected.
- **Bundle code-splitting.** The build is a single ~1.18 MB chunk (mostly
  Three.js). Fine for now; lazy-load / split if first-load matters.
  - **Shortcuts** add shortcuts to activate all tools
  **Print the cutlist** print the cutlist to pdf (best) or an image showing all dimensions of each panel, their name, etc.
