 * Heal an imperial design that drifted while whole-millimetre / grid rounding
 * was in effect: snap every panel's thickness back onto the exact unit grid
 * (e.g. 19 mm → a true 3/4"), then close the hairline gaps at every joint so a
 * row of parts adds up exactly.
 *
 * Gap closing is a fixed-point relaxation. Joints (pairs of faces already within
 * {@link CONTACT_TOL}) are detected once. Each connected cluster is anchored at
 * its min-corner panel; a breadth-first pass assigns every panel a depth from
 * that anchor. Then we relax repeatedly — for each joint the panel *further* from
 * the anchor is moved onto the nearer one — until nothing moves. Because motion
 * only ever flows away from the fixed anchor, it converges (no oscillation) and
 * the anchor's corner stays put while the far end pulls in to close every gap.
